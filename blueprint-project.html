            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
                For this role, I collaborate with a team of developers to improve the design 
                of a period tracking app for 
                <a href="https://www.theperiodpurse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">The Period Purse</a>. 
                We were to expand the functionality of the app by adding features requested by the client.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-5">
                The main goal of this project was to expand the functionality of 
                the app by adding features requested by the client, such as ovulation tracking and
                an improved UX experience.

            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-5">
                As we have only recently begun this project, my contributions have been limited to
                creating wireframes and mockups for the app. I have also been working on the
                possible design improvements and new features that we could add to the app.
                I have also worked on bug testing, and reporting issues to the dev team.
